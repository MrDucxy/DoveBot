# Trev

Trev is a package for getting random nsfw (and memes soon) from reddit.

You can also get custom ones.

The list of methods is too long to mention but check subreddits.json for all the random nsfw images categories (accessible in this.nsfw) that represent each method.

## Usage example

<pre>
const trev = require("trev");

async function main() {
  let hentai = await trev.nsfw.hentai();
  console.log(
    `${hentai.title} | ${hentai.author}\nFrom: ${hentai.subreddit}\nMedia: ${hentai.media}\nisNsfw: ${hentai.over_18}`
  );
}

main();
</pre>

## Other methods

<code>getCustomSubreddit(subreddit)</code><br>
This is for getting the images from a subreddit you are choosing.

<code>isGfyLink(url)</code><br>
Many nsfw gifs/videos are from redgifs/gfycat, and those are not raw links unlike the others. So it would be useful to check if it's one of those links. This method is for checking if a url is a Gfy link. In that case you can use the 2 methods just below.

<code>rawGfy(url)</code><br>
Gets the raw video url from a Gfy url. Prefer converting the link into a gfy embed (next method) first otherwise the performance will not be good.

<code>gfyIframe(url)</code><br>
Converts a normal Gfy url into a Gfy embed. The point of this is that a Gfy embed page contains way less HTML than the normal page, which will save speed when doing web scraping (rawGfy() uses web scraping)
