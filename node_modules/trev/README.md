# Trev

Trev is a package for getting random nsfw and memes from reddit.

You can also get custom ones.

The list of methods is too long to mention but check subreddits.json for all the random nsfw images categories (accessible in this.nsfw) that represent each method.

## Usage example

<pre>
const trev = require("trev");

async function main() {
  let hentai = await trev.nsfw.hentai();
  console.log(
    `${hentai.title} | ${hentai.author}\nFrom: ${hentai.subreddit}\nMedia: ${hentai.media}\nisNsfw: ${hentai.over_18}`
  );
}

main();
</pre>

## Other methods

<code>getCustomSubreddit(subreddit)</code><br>
This is for getting the images from a subreddit you are choosing. This will now add /r/ if you forgot to add it (or / if you did r/).

<code>isImgurUpload(url)</code><br>
Many memes are uploaded to imgur, but imgur links are not raw. This method is used to check if a link is an imgur upload. It will not get gallery uploads since those require web scraping to get the raw link of, which adds a ton of packages.

<code>getRawImgur(url)</code>
Gives you a raw imgur link from a normal imgur link. Super useful for memes. It checks if it's an imgur upload first (method above)

<code>isGfyLink(url)</code><br>
Many nsfw gifs/videos are from redgifs/gfycat, and those are not raw links unlike the others. So it would be useful to check if it's one of those links.

<code>gfyIframe(url)</code><br>
Converts a normal Gfy url into a Gfy embed. The point of this is that a Gfy embed page contains way less HTML than the normal page, which will save speed when doing web scraping (rawGfy() uses web scraping)
